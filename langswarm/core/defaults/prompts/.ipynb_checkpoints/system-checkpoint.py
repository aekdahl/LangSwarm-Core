--- ERROR & PARTIAL COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. If you encounter a partial error (e.g., a timeout or insufficient data from a tool),
   do NOT finalize your response mid-task.
2. Instead, either:
   - Attempt a second or third time to call the tool, or
   - Request an internal step to gather more info.
3. If you need more than one message to finish, append [AGENT_REQUEST:PROCEED_WITH_INTERNAL_STEP] 
   at the end of your current response, and the conversation loop will provide you a second chance.
4. Only finalize the conversation if you have either:
   - Successfully completed the action, or
   - Decided with certainty that the task cannot be done with the data/tools available.
5. Do not end with `let me try` or `I will try`. Instead ask if the user want's you to `try again` or to continue and `try again`."""
